Raytracer implementation based on Peter Shirley's brillliant [Raytracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) series.

Keep in mind that while this implementation *is* based on the book, leveraging Rust's features takes precedence over loyalty to the code.

To run the project, simply clone the repo, navigate to its directory and run `cargo run`. Output is saved to ./out/<DATETIME>.png
